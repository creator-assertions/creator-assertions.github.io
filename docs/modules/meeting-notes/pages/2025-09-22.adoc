=== Review metadata assertion PR #5: Add media identifiers guidance

* ðŸŽ¥ _10'17":_ Reviewed https://github.com/decentralized-identity/cawg-metadata-assertion/pull/5[metadata assertion PR #5: Add media identifiers guidance].

Current draft (visible https://cawg.io/metadata/1.2-draft+media-identifiers/#_use_with_media_industry_identifiers[in rendered form here]) is close to final form. Will likely bring it to full CAWG meeting on 6 October.

=== Review identity assertion PR #240: Add X.509 trust model guidance

* ðŸŽ¥ _24'03":_ Reviewed https://github.com/decentralized-identity/cawg-identity-assertion/pull/240[identity assertion PR #240: Add X.509 trust model guidance].

This is an early draft and will likely undergo some significant revision before it is ready for final approval. Some discussion points from today:

* Concern was raised over the reference to Adobe Acrobat Trust List (AATL) in the draft. After speaking with relevant Adobe product managers, we agree that AATL is not suitable for CAWG's purposes and we will remove this reference.
* Questions raised about the viability of vLEIs from GLEIF. That is a separate work stream not directly related to the X.509 trust list question.
* Questions raised about the use of e-mail (S/MIME) EKUs. We will investigate the viability of enabling document-signing EKUs only. The inclusion of e-mail EKUs was based on C2PA's trust model, which does the same.
* Some concerns raised about the quality of organizational identity vetting that is done by CAs. Will investigate the governance regime for the issuance of OV certs.
* To discuss further: Do we need a CAWG-specific EKU and/or trust list?
