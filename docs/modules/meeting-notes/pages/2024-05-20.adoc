=== 10 min: Move to approve endorsement assertion specification

*MOTION:* As per Community Specification License process link:++https://github.com/creator-assertions/endorsement-assertion/blob/main/governance.md#4-specification-development-process++[§4: Specification development process], I move to promote the xref:endorsement:ROOT:index.adoc[] from draft to approved (version 1.0 final) status:

[quote,Community Specification License :: Governance Policy]
____
4.2. Draft. Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved to become a “Draft Specification.” Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Specification, the Draft Specification becomes the basis for all going forward work on that specification.

4.3. Working Group Approval. Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its specification as described in the Scope, it will Approve that Draft Specification and progress it to “Approved Specification” status.
