=== Update from First Person project

ðŸŽ¥ _43:29":_ Drummond gave an update on the First Person Project, which will soon be spun up as the Decentralized Trust Graph Working Group within Trust Over IP Foundation. FPP aims to solve proof of personhood without using a global biometric database. He explained two types of verifiable digital credentials: personal credentials and verifiable relationship credentials. The project uses zero-knowledge proofs to provide strong proof of personhood while supporting anonymity when needed. Drummond also discussed the concept of privacy-preserving personas and the anatomy of a digital wallet that supports first-person credentials. The presentation concluded with an explanation of how personal credentials and verifiable relationships create a trust triangle, strengthening the trust signal through zero-knowledge proofs.

*ACTION:* Drummond and Andrew to meet to ensure that FPP and CAWG VC efforts are technically aligned.
