== Notes

=== Review PRs for identity 1.0

==== #141: Changed trust triangle to trust diamond

ðŸŽ¥ _2'15":_ Review link:++https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/141++[PR #141: Changed trust triangle to trust diamond in 9.1].

*ACTION (âœ…):* Eric to make minor wording changes as discussed in the meeting and merge.

==== #138: Credential revocation

ðŸŽ¥ _9'02":_ Review link:++https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/138++[PR #138: Write up section on credential revocation].

*ACTION (âœ…):* Eric to adjust wording:

* Any evidence about revocation should be part of the identity assertion consumer's report on the identity assertion.
* Revocation at time of signing should be cause for choosing untrusted status.

*ACTION* (interested members): Please review link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/138/commits/a1a0d23c0cf25b219c041e2cc86817520480a48e[proposed new wording] based on todayâ€™s meeting.

==== #136: Formalize trusted, well-formed, and revoked status for identity assertion signatures

ðŸŽ¥ _42'09":_ Review link:++https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/136++[PR #136: Formalize trusted, well-formed, and revoked status for identity assertion signatures].

*ACTION (âœ…):* Eric to adjust wording to avoid implication that credential issuer must perform the revocation. Approved to merge after that change.

==== Updated draft available

An updated draft incorporating #141 and #136 is link:https://creator-assertions.github.io/identity/1.0-draft[available here].

=== 1.0 ratification vote next week

ðŸŽ¥ _49'18":_ Discuss ratifaction vote. Agreed to proceed with ratification next week.

*IMPORTANT:* We will vote on ratification of the 1.0 version of the identity assertion in the *29 July 2024* meeting.

*ACTION* (all members): Very last call for review of the 1.0-draft spec. Please flag any items that feel like blockers to you.

=== Training and data mining assertion 1.1-draft

ðŸŽ¥ _49'43":_ Eric proposed to open a working draft for a future (1.1) version of the training and data mining assertion specification.

The only changes _so far_ since the approved 1.0 draft are:

* New version "1.1-draft".
* Revert language in "Contributing" section from approved to working draft.
* Adding a note stating that an approved 1.1 version is expected late this year.

Additional changes are expected and the 1.1-draft text provides space for that work to proceed.

*DECISION:* Approved.

*ACTION (âœ…):* Eric to promote 1.1 from pre-draft to draft.

=== Review identity assertion 1.x

ðŸŽ¥ _53'08":_ Review the 1.x-draft version of the identity assertion.

*ACTION:* Eric to convene subgroup meeting later in the week to revise 8.1.1 example to match likely usage pattern.

*ACTION (âœ…):* Eric to merge link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/126[PR #126: Add VC schema description]. Group agreed that having two separate drafts for the VC version of this specification was confusing.

*ACTION:* Eric to review TO DO items and add GitHub issues.

NOTE: FYI there is active work underway at Adobe to validate this part of the spec in code. See link:https://github.com/scouten-adobe/cawg-identity-core[GitHub: scouten-adobe/cawg-identity-core]. Be aware this is very early code.
