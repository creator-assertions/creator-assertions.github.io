[quote,Community Specification License :: Governance Policy]
____
4.1. Pre-Draft. Any Participant may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Specification of that Working Group. The Maintainer will designate each submission as a “Pre-Draft” document.

4.2. Draft. Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved to become a “Draft Specification.” Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Specification, the Draft Specification becomes the basis for all going forward work on that specification.

4.3. Working Group Approval. Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its specification as described in the Scope, it will Approve that Draft Specification and progress it to “Approved Specification” status.

=== 15 min: Review identity assertion 1.x

Review last week shows some areas of work. After meeting, I'll codify these into GitHub issues for the 1.x milestone:

* Review discussion of 8.1.1 example (not likely that wallet will accept signature material in this case)
* Merge the two draft versions?
* Several TO DO items

NOTE: Active work underway on our end to validate this part of the spec in code.

=== 5 min: Closing and review

Invitation to subsequent meetings, which will typically be on Mondays.
