=== Introduction to JPEG Trust work

ðŸŽ¥ _4'51":_ Philippe Rixon presented on the relationship between the JPEG Trust initiative and the C2PA effort, explaining the use cases, requirements, and the trust framework.

The initiative started with addressing fake media and has evolved to focus on provenance, authenticity, and intellectual property rights. The first edition of JPEG Trust was published, and the second edition is in the drafting stage.

Philippe highlighted the addition of intellectual property rights to the scope of JPEG Trust. This includes attribution, which requires identifying the creator, and rights declaration, which involves expressing and protecting both moral and commercial rights.

Philippe explained that CAWG's work on identity and metadata is crucial for JPEG Trust. The integration involves using CAWG's identity assertions and metadata structures to identify creators, editors, and rights holders. These assertions are essential for attributing media and ensuring the accuracy of provenance information.

=== Review PR 207: Limit validity period for identity claims verifications

ðŸŽ¥ _59'39":_ Reviewed link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/207[PR 207: Limit validity period for identity claims verifications].

Eric proposed a maximum lifetime for identity verifications, suggesting that the identity claims aggregator must renew the verification at least annually. The group discussed the implications of this proposal and the need for regular verification.

Some concerns were raised about the arbitrary nature of the requirement for annual renewal. The group agreed to leave this PR open for further consideration.
