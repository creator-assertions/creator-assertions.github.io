=== 10 min: Move to approve endorsement assertion specification

*MOTION:* As per Community Specification License process link:++https://github.com/creator-assertions/endorsement-assertion/blob/main/governance.md#4-specification-development-process++[§4: Specification development process], I move to promote the xref:endorsement:ROOT:index.adoc[] from draft to approved (version 1.0 final) status:

[quote,Community Specification License :: Governance Policy]
____
4.2. Draft. Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved to become a “Draft Specification.” Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Specification, the Draft Specification becomes the basis for all going forward work on that specification.

4.3. Working Group Approval. Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its specification as described in the Scope, it will Approve that Draft Specification and progress it to “Approved Specification” status.

=== 30 min: Review open identity assertion PRs

I'd like to land the following PRs this week:

* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/103[#103: Add optional protections against unexpected claim and unexpected claim generators]. Has the required two approvals (thank you, Christian and Yondon); want to make sure concerns from Nigel are addressed.
** Related: Request approval to close link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/96[#96: Signer payload fixes] without merging.
* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/107[#107: Revise Overview section to include new trust signal diagrams]. I’ve added new diagrams as suggested in last week’s meeting.
* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/98[#98: Introduce an optional `signer_payload.role` field].
** I’ve extended this PR to allow multiple roles to be specified.
** I would like to avoid the additional complexity and dependency on other role definitions as that creates a substantially larger implementation burden for verifiers.

=== 15 min: Discuss ISCC (new ISO standard) and how it might fit here

Discuss link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/113[#113: Consider how to reference ISCC in identity assertion or somewhere in C2PA ecosystem]. No concrete proposal at this time.

=== 2 min: Heads up on training and data mining assertion

Expecting some feedback in next week or two that may lead to requested revisions to the xref:training-and-data-mining:ROOT:index.adoc[]. If you have concerns or questions, this would be a good time to raise them.
