== Meeting notes

ðŸŽ¥ _10'41":_ This was an open meeting with primary goals of reviewing proposed wording around the use of identity and metadata assertions in combination and preparing an initial draft of a metadata example.

=== Review metadata assertion PR #4: Recommend use of identity assertion to attest to metadata authorship

ðŸŽ¥ _13'38":_ Reviewed link:https://github.com/decentralized-identity/cawg-metadata-assertion/pull/4[metadata assertion PR #4: Recommend use of identity assertion to attest to metadata authorship].

Group agreed to wording. Will discuss in next full CAWG meeting.

=== Review metadata assertion PR #5: Add media identifiers appendix

ðŸŽ¥ _15'58":_ Reviewed link:https://github.com/decentralized-identity/cawg-metadata-assertion/pull/5[metadata assertion PR #5: Add media identifiers appendix].

Revised wording based on discussion.

Challenges (unresolved as of yet):

* Lacking an easily linkable list of metadata namespaces.
* Dublin Core has a fairly coarse set of contributor roles. Motion picture may need more nuance.

To research:

* MovieLabs data format (may be too verbose -- and only available as an XML syntax)
* Library of Congress schemas

Updated the PR to add a rough draft example using EIDR and HAND identifiers.
