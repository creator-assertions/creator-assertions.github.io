=== New members and invited guests introduction

* ðŸŽ¥ _6'26":_ Nicky Hickman, Digital Egret
* ðŸŽ¥ _7'07":_ Wenjing Chu, Trust Over IP / Futurewei
* ðŸŽ¥ _7'40":_ Alan Karp
* ðŸŽ¥ _8'22":_ Andy Parsons, Adobe
* ðŸŽ¥ _8'37":_ Santiago Lyon, Adobe
* ðŸŽ¥ _8'53":_ Rand McKinney, Adobe
* ðŸŽ¥ _9'12":_ Jen Tse, Adobe
* ðŸŽ¥ _9'26":_ Michael Klein, Adobe
* ðŸŽ¥ _9'45":_ Nicholas Salvemini, Adobe
* ðŸŽ¥ _10'15":_ Erik Passoja, SAG/AFTRA

=== Defining a shared use case

ðŸŽ¥ _13'55":_ Eric proposed the following use case as an organizing rubric:

.Proposed use case for agentic identity in CAWG
****
At time X, content *creator* _Alice_ (human or organization) invokes text-chat agent B which invokes image-generation agent C, which produces still-image content D, which is ultimately returned to content creator Alice. Alice then posts asset D to social media.

At time Y, content *consumer* _Emily_ finds asset D. She has questions about how this asset was created and submits it to a C2PA verification site. The report contains information about Alice's identity and the role of agents B and C in producing the content D.

IMPORTANT: Time Y could be arbitrarily later than Time X -- anywhere from minutes to years later.
****

*DISCUSSION:*

* Is this a problem worth solving? *Enthusiastic yes.*

* Suggested amendments to proposed use case:
** Adopt Leonard's <<proposed_terms_and_definitions>>.
** Important to encode _version_ of agent/tool as capabilities will evolve over time.
** Spell out more about what Emily's questions about the content are. Some proposed examples:
*** Is Alice really Alice?
*** 

* Suggested variations on the proposed use case:
** Asset D gets published/circulated prior to having been returned to Alice.
** Asset D is created maliciously in Alice's name by one or more agents.

* Limitations on CAWG's scope:
** Transactional authentication and authorization is handled by other protocols and out of scope for CAWG.
** _Documenting_ what chain of delegation was used _is_ in scope for CAWG.
** Documenting rights and payment expectations remain out of scope for CAWG. (Refer such topics to JPEG Trust.)

ðŸŽ¥ _26'30":_ Leonard proposed that we adopt the following definitions:

.Proposed terms and definitions:
[#proposed_terms_and_definitions]
****
Tool:: a stateless operation where you pass all parameters in a single call
NOTE: You need an agent when you have more than one tool and you require state between the tools plus there is additional logic that may be required 
NOTE: Some tool models support returning information to the caller (such as for HITL interaction)
 
Skill (aka workflow):: a system where the set of operations across multiple tools/agents/etc is predefined and hardcoded.
EXAMPLE: a prepare for web skill that would know to do things such as color convert, optimize and save as PDF/A
 
Agent:: a system, with a defined (but possibly mutable) goal, that can dynamically direct its own process (and possible tool usage), usually backed by an xLM.
****

=== Review of existing protocols

ðŸŽ¥ _34'39":_ The primary protocols/mechanisms for interacting with and discovering agents appear to be:

* *link:https://github.com/a2aproject[A2A project]*
* *link:https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol[Model Content Protocol (MCP)]*
* *link:https://github.com/agntcy[AGNTCY]*
* *link:https://spiffe.io[SPIFFE]*
* *link:https://projnanda.github.io/projnanda/[NANDA]*

*DISCUSSION:* 

Of these, only AGNTCY appears to have even a discussion of agent identity that could outlive a specific transaction or interaction. (In terms of the use case above, any understanding of the identity of agents B and C doesn't live beyond Alice receiving the content back from B.) General consensus that this assessment is correct, with the caveat that NANDA may also be exploring this space.

ðŸŽ¥ _41'06":_ Makki Elfatih gave a presentation outlining the current state of major agentic protocols and the authentication and authorization mechanisms that are included here.

=== Interaction with / collaboration with C2PA

ðŸŽ¥ _1h01'05":_ C2PA has its own AI task force. Historically, the boundary between C2PA and CAWG has been that C2PA provides standards for what hardware and software implementations of C2PA can directly attest to and CAWG provides standards for human-sourced metadata and attribution.

NOTE: Most of the discussion about this topic is in recording https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/share/z8Bz6X5uzsctFo15a1Kbh0I4tda0Xnmbb0qH8kWYzpzCii9CbFqiR3MON5fRm3vG.Nf4nxa5ve79v7e-g[part 2 (29m)].

*DISCUSSION / OUTCOMES:*

* C2PA will host discussion about _tool_ identity when there are not humans in the loop.
* CAWG will host discussion about _agent_ identity and documenting _delegation of authority_ when there are humans (including organizations) in the loop.
* There's a related discussion with DIF about object capabilities APIs, which may be partially related.
* Call for C2PA to build more of an _ecosystem_ of related standards and SDOs.

*ACTION:* Andor, Scott, and Eric to meet later this week to discuss upcoming AI identity task force and how CAWG relates to it and to draft a charter for CAWG AI task force if applicable.

=== CAWG web site proposed update

ðŸŽ¥ _21'19":_ Team at Adobe have been working on a proposed redesign of the CAWG web site, which was shared in the meeting. The redesign can be viewed in the video (starting at 21'58") or by downloading and building from link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/creator-assertions.github.io/pull/11[PR #11 "Draft home page revision"].

*FEEDBACK:*

* Tagline should say "attribution" not "authorship."
* Home page text should talk about CAWG's role as an SDO and avoid talking about (directly) "empowering" content authors.
