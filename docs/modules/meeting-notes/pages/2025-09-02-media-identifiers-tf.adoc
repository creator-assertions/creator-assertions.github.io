=== Review metadata PR #5: Add media identifiers guidance

🎥 _11'34":_ Reviewed https://github.com/decentralized-identity/cawg-metadata-assertion/pull/5[PR #5: Add media identifiers guidance].

NOTE: This draft PR is also available in rendered form on the CAWG site. See https://cawg.io/metadata/1.2-draft+media-identifiers/#_use_with_media_industry_identifiers[§6, “Use with media industry identifiers.”]

🎥 _14'57":_ General agreement that https://cawg.io/metadata/1.2-draft+media-identifiers/#_use_case[§6.1, “Use case,”] fits all of the represented industries with a minor adjustment to say (bold is revised):

[quote]
It is often not logistically feasible to have individual contributors *involved in a signing process relating to the final rendered content,* ...

*ACTION:* Jeremy to report back on supply chain and update on using https://isni.org/[ISNI] as artist identifier.

🎥 _27'09":_ Reviewed https://cawg.io/metadata/1.2-draft+media-identifiers/#_use_externally_defined_namespaces_and_field_names[§6.2, “Use externally-defined namespaces and field names.”] This section was renamed during the meeting from “Use of externally-defined identifiers” since externally-defined identifiers is addressed in a subsequent section.

*ACTION:* Eric to schedule time in regular CAWG meeting to discuss the MAY statement at the end of §6.2. (Looking for feedback from the person who originally requested that line.)

🎥 _40'19":_ Reviewed https://cawg.io/metadata/1.2-draft+media-identifiers/#_use_externally_defined_data_sources_and_identifiers[§6.3, “Use externally-defined data sources and identifiers.”]

Music industry has a challenge in that there are not widely-used, publicly-resolvable unique identifiers for most musical artists. Some work towards using https://isni.org/[ISNI] as artist identifier, but this is not widespread.

From Jenny via chat:

____
* SCAPR - International Performer Number
* IPN - for registered performers of recordings in SCAPR managed territories.
* CISAC - Interested Party Information (base number and name numbers) for songwriters and publishers of works.
* ISNI ISO Name Identifier bridges all plus companies, brands, fictitious characters, musical groups, etc.
____

*ACTION:* Will, Richard, and Erik to huddle on a short list of example registries to use in §6.3 and report back with an update to use in the spec.
