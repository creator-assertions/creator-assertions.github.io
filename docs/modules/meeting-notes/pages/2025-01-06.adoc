* *ACTION:* Eric to review current revocation mechanisms and draft a PR describing at least one preferred revocation mechanism. â†’ *DONE:* See PR #204 on today's agenda.
* *ACTION:* Eric to follow up on feedback provided by Philippe on more concrete examples for how `constrained` might be defined in training and data mining assertion. â†’ *TRACKING:* Filed as link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/training-and-data-mining-assertion/issues/7[issue #7: Provide a better definition of `constrained`].

=== PR #203: Add optional `method` field for describing the technique used to verify account/URI control

ðŸŽ¥ _6'36":_ Reviewed link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/203[PR #203: Add optional `method` field for describing the technique used to verify account/URI control].

*PR Overview:* Eric described the PR as focusing on improving transparency in how the identity claims aggregator verifies identity signals, including editorial changes and renaming verification methods for clarity.

*Verification Methods:* Since the last meeting, Eric renamed two fields to provide clearer descriptions of the techniques used.

*Security Concerns:* Peleus raised concerns about the security of using meta tags for verification, noting that while it is a standard method, it may be susceptible to attacks. Eric acknowledged the trade-offs between accessibility and security.

*Name Confusion:* The roles played by _identity claims aggregator,_ _identity provider,_ and _named actor_ are not immediately clear to people reading this spec.

*ACTION:* Eric to revise PR to:

* Look for a more generic "federated authentication" name than the existing `cawg.oauth2`. (Review discussion at ðŸŽ¥ _18'40"._)
* Clarify which identity signals are self-asserted (DNS, meta tag, etc.) vs asserted by a third party (e-mail, federated). (Review discussion at ðŸŽ¥ _18'40"_ in which Tim introduces the concept of direct vs delegated verification.)
* Clarify who is the _identity provider_ in the third party cases. (Review discussion at  ðŸŽ¥ _28'38"._)

*ACTION:* Brian McInnis to link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/203#discussion_r1889002960[add a `cawg.webauthn`] option. (This can be a separate PR.)

=== PR #204: Add section on credential status / revocation

ðŸŽ¥ _30'47":_ Reviewed new link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/204[PR #204: Add section on credential status / revocation].

*ACTION:* Eric to create new PR to contemplate maximum lifetime of verifications? (Review discussion at ðŸŽ¥ _32'21"._)

New PR so we'll discuss further next week.

=== PR #205: Finalize URI for ICA context and schema

ðŸŽ¥ _36'05":_ Reviewed new link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/205[PR #205: Finalize URI for ICA context and schema].

*ACTION: (âœ…)* Eric to merge PR 205.
