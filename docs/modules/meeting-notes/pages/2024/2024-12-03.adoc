== Meeting notes

=== New members introduction

* ðŸŽ¥ _0'50":_ Jeremy Uzan, Universal Music

=== Review previous action items

ðŸŽ¥ _1'36":_ All action items from xref:2024/2024-11-11.adoc[] resulted in merged PRs, except for:

* *ACTION:* Eric to review current revocation mechanisms and draft a PR describing at least one preferred revocation mechanism. â†’ *TRACKING:* Added comment to existing link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/171[issue #171: Recommend (require?) use of bitstring status lists for revocation?].
* *ACTION:* Eric to follow up on feedback provided by Phillippe on more concrete examples for how `constrained` might be defined in training and data mining assertion. â†’ *TRACKING:* Filed as link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/training-and-data-mining-assertion/issues/7[issue #7: Provide a better definition of `constrained`].

=== Overall review of identity claims aggregation model

ðŸŽ¥ _2'51":_ From previous meeting:

> Aside from issues flagged for 1.1 release and PRs being discussed today, what open issues / blockers / concerns do you have about the identity claims aggregation model being added in 1.1?

Members expressed support for the model, highlighting its usefulness in providing assertions that cannot be easily validated without a trusted aggregator.

Eric reiterated that there are some issues flagged as blockers for version 1.1 that still need to be addressed before ratification.

=== Review PR #188: Add support for verified web site

ðŸŽ¥ _5'15":_ Review revised version of existing link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/188[PR #188: Add support for verified web site].

Eric presented a revised proposal for verified websites, which simplifies the verification process by removing prescriptive language about using meta tags.

Members agreed with the new approach, noting that there could be multiple ways to verify websites, and the proposal is on the right track.

Christian and David raised concerns about the lack of detail on how verification methods are performed, suggesting the need for a descriptor or protocol identifier to ensure the level of assurance. Eric agreed to draft a proposal for allowing identity claims aggregator to describe its verification method. â†’ *TRACKING* as link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/202[issue #202] and flagged as a blocker for 1.1 ratification.

*ACTION (âœ…):* Eric to rename verified identity type from `cawg.domain_control_validation` to `cawg.web_site` and merge.

=== Proposal to split identity assertion spec into core data model spec and separate "methods" specs

ðŸŽ¥ _40'58":_ Eric suggested decoupling specific methods such as the current Â§8.1 and Â§8.2 from the identity assertion spec and creating separate specs for each method, similar to the DID protocol and methods.

The group discussed the potential benefits and challenges of this approach, including the possibility of creating a more modular and flexible framework.

No clear outcome. Will revisit in a future meeting.
