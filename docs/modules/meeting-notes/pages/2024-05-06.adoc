== Agenda

=== 5 min: Start meeting

* Start recording
* Welcome and community specification license reminder
* Agenda review and call for agenda items

=== 5 min: New members introduction

Two new members this meeting:

* üé• _2'02":_ Pamela Dingle, Microsoft
* üé• _2'18":_ Yondon Fu, Livepeer

=== 30 min: Review claim/claim-generator PR

üé• _2'47":_ See link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/103[PR #103].

Changes made since last week‚Äôs first draft:

* SHA-256 is no longer hard-coded. Updated to add an `alg` parameter and match the C2PA‚Äôs list of recognized hash algorithms.
* Proofreading suggestions from Christian and Paul.

Open issues:

* How to allow multiple identity assertions to use these protections?
** Zeroing out other identity assertions?
** Compute identity assertions in sequence?
** Allow only ‚Äúlast‚Äù identity assertion to use claim hash protection?

* Do we need the full cert chain or can we simplify to end-entity cert only?
* OK to close #96 without merging?

...

üé• _7'12":_ Long discussion of potential challenges with multiple identity assertions employing the expected claim/claim generator protections.

ACTION (‚úÖ): Eric to split out the `sig_type` change from PRs 96 and 104. DONE: See new link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/105[PR #105].

ACTION: Eric to revise PR 104 to allow identity assertion signer to add expected `signer_payload` or signing credentials.

ACTION: Eric to revise PR 99 to describe the adversarial claim generator attack. Include the trust-bubbles discussion shown in the meeting at üé• _39'34"._

=== 15 min: Proposal: Declare implementer‚Äôs draft

üé• _50'26":_ See link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/104[PR #104] which will allow implementers to proceed using the core structure of the identity assertion while non-structural details are resolved.

NOTE: This is a heads-up discussion. I would like to move for merging this PR in the next meeting on 20 May. If the idea of locking the core structure of the identity assertion causes heartache, please speak up within these two weeks.

Discussion, but no resolution.

=== 15 min: Review trust model PR

üé• _1h01'32":_ See link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/99[PR #99].

No new action items.

=== 10 min: Endorsement assertion ready to approve?

üé• _1h09'36":_ Those who are interested in the endorsement, please re-review link:https://creator-assertions.github.io/endorsement/1.0-draft/[the latest draft], which includes changes approved last week.

I‚Äôd like to move for approval of 1.0 final specification in next meeting (20 May).

=== 5 min: Closing and review

Invitation to subsequent meetings, which will typically be on Mondays.

IMPORTANT: Reminder that next week‚Äôs meeting (13 May) is cancelled due to an internal Adobe event.
