=== Review metadata PR #4: Recommend use of identity assertion to attest to metadata authorship

ðŸŽ¥ _12'53":_ Reviewed metadata assertion link:https://github.com/decentralized-identity/cawg-metadata-assertion/pull/4[PR #4: Recommend use of identity assertion to attest to metadata authorship].

Four primary concerns were raised about the proposed new language:

. There's an interest in having a mechanism to specify whether the identity assertion signer has _authored_ the metadata in question or is _providing_ metadata that it obtained from another source. The binary of reference vs do-not-reference is potentially insufficient.
. There's a concern about who has the right to assert metadata on behalf of another actor.
. Potentially add language to discusourage the use of metadata assertion to assert intellectual property rights, which is more appropriately covered in forthcoming work from JPEG Trust.
. Additional guidance may be needed to clarify what metadata should be placed in the C2PA metadata assertion (i.e. directly attested to by the hardware or software involved) versus which should be placed in CAWG metadata assertion.

ACTION: Eric to work further with Andrew, Richard, and Phillippe to resolve outstanding concerns.
