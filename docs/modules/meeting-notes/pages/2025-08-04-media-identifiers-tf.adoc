== Meeting notes

=== SB 942

ðŸŽ¥ _3'12":_ Erik (P) led a discussion about SB 942 and introduced a proposal for structured disclosure of the nature of generative and human-driven alterations that have occurred in the construction of a piece of digital media.

=== Media-specific identifiers

ðŸŽ¥ _26'29":_ Eric (S) led a discussion about ensuring that the right participants are in the room for future MITF discussions. Agreed that _transport_ provenance is out of scope for C2PA and thus CAWG.

Richard restated a preference that the CAWG metadata assertion be used for a minimal set of data that can link out to other authoritative sources of information.

ACTION: Eric to draft a PR to metadata assertion document stating the above.
