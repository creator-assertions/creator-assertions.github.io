=== Update on identity assertion 1.0

_0'56":_ Some concerns had been raised privately about the X.509 flavor of the identity assertion and some of the messaging about the dividing line between C2PA claim generator signature as being reserved for hardware and software vendors and CAWG being the primary home for individual and organizational identity.

We discussed the wording regarding claim generator signatures in the C2PA specification, notably link:https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_trust_lists[¬ß14.4, ‚ÄúTrust Lists,‚Äù] which says:

> In addition to the list of trust anchors provided in the C2PA Trust List, a validator should allow a user to configure additional trust anchor stores, and should provide default options or offer lists maintained by external parties that the user may opt into to populate the validator‚Äôs trust anchor store for C2PA signers.

This leaves open the possibility for other trust lists to be chosen by validators and for claim generators with X.509 signing ability to use certs that appear on those trust lists. Eric clarified that the choice of trust lists for validators is more of a market question than a policy question, indicating that Adobe will likely implement the X.509 flavor of the COG identity assertion, but that there is flexibility for different parties' plans and preferences.

IMPORTANT: We will hold a ratification vote on the 1.0 version of the spec in the next meeting, scheduled for *9 September 2024.*

=== Retract HTTPS API?

_13'51":_ Consider retracting link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/168[PR #168: Define HTTPS API for identity assertion signing services].

In talking with some of the identity providers that are either in this call or otherwise interested in this, what we're seeing is what they're offering is not to be the identity assertion signer, but to provide a credential that a third-party, such as our Identity Management Service could access and then aggregate into the verifiable credential that in our case we IMS would then produce. That removes the need for a standard HTTP API surface.

*ACTION (‚úÖ):* Eric to close PR 168 without merging.

=== Review PR# 169: Define identity provider

_15'12":_ Review link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/169[PR #169: Define identity provider].

*ACTION (‚úÖ):* Eric to merge PR 169.

=== Proposed change of focus to identity assertion 1.x (VC)

_18'29":_ Eric proposed changing the name of section 8.1 from ‚ÄúW3C verifiable credentials‚Äù to ‚Äúidentity aggregation‚Äù to better reflect the process of aggregating identity signals from various sources into a single assertion. Adjusting the terminology to ‚Äúidentity aggregation‚Äù aims to avoid confusion with the specific technology of W3C Verifiable Credentials and to accurately describe the current practises.

The discussion clarified the role of identity aggregators as trusted entities that bind identity signals to specific assets, highlighting the need for a trust list for these entities.

The group considered the possibility of a future where individuals could sign directly with their own verifiable credentials, acknowledging that the current state does not widely support this yet.

Tim Cappalli suggested adjusting the naming to ‚Äúidentity _claims_ aggregation‚Äù and the group agreed to that.

*ACTION:* Eric to draft a PR to change the name as described.

=== Update on CAWG web site

_37'29":_ Eric announced the acquisition of the domain name cawg.io for hosting the standard. Expect the content currently on creator-assertions.github.io to transition to the new domain in the near future.
