üé• _4'21":_ *MOTION:* As per Community Specification License process link:++https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/blob/main/governance.md#4-specification-development-process++[¬ß4: Specification development process], I submit the following three assertion specifications as candidate drafts and move to promote each document from *pre-draft* to *draft* status.

* xref:endorsement:ROOT:index.adoc[]
* xref:metadata:ROOT:index.adoc[]
* xref:training-and-data-mining:ROOT:index.adoc[]

IMPORTANT: For these three assertions, I expect to move to *Working Group Approval* status fairly quickly (perhaps two weeks from now). If you are interested in the content of these specifications, please signal your availability to review the content.

[quote,Community Specification License :: Governance Policy]
____
4.1. Pre-Draft. Any Participant may submit a proposed initial draft document as a candidate Draft Specification of that Working Group. The Maintainer will designate each submission as a ‚ÄúPre-Draft‚Äù document.

4.2. Draft. Each Pre-Draft document of a Working Group must first be Approved to become a ‚ÄúDraft Specification.‚Äù Once the Working Group approves a document as a Draft Specification, the Draft Specification becomes the basis for all going forward work on that specification.

4.3. Working Group Approval. Once a Working Group believes it has achieved the objectives for its specification as described in the Scope, it will Approve that Draft Specification and progress it to ‚ÄúApproved Specification‚Äù status.
____

'''

*DECISION:* Approved. I've since published new versions of these specifications that reflect draft status.

=== 10 min: PR review: Create 1.0 draft of this specification without W3C VC discussion

üé• _6'57":_ Following up on last week's discussion, review link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/59[PR #59] which creates a `1.0-draft` version of this specification. In this version, the discussion of W3C VC credentials is removed except for a note stating that it will be added in a future version of the specification.

*RELATED:* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/60[PR #60] restores the discussion of W3C VC credentials from the previous working draft.

*MOTION:* Eric requests approval from the WG to merge PR #59 as draft of version 1.0 of the identity assertion specification.

*MOTION:* Eric requests approval from the WG to approve PR #60 as the working draft for a future (1.x) version identity assertion specification. While in working-draft status, this specification can be found on the site with the link:https://creator-assertions.github.io/identity/1.x-add-w3c-vc/[`1.x-add-w3c-vc` label].

üé• _8'39":_ This led to a discussion about approval policy and code ownership.

*DECISION:* PRs should only be merged when two PR approvals have been given by group members (other than the original PR author) and an opportunity to discuss in a weekly meeting has occurred.

*ACTION:* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/59[PR #59], which creates a `1.0-draft` version of this specification, has one of the two required PR approvals. Please read and approve or request changes as you see fit.

*ACTION:* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/60[PR #60], which creates a 1.x draft has changes requested. Scouten to review and revise accordingly.

=== 2 min: FYI: upcoming ICANN workshop presentation

üé• _12'20":_ Eric and Santiago Lyon will be presenting at ICANN79 on 6 March 2024, similar to ToIP presentation.

=== X.509 EKU discussion

üé• _12'38":_ The group started reviewing open issues for the identity 1.0 milestone.

First discussion was around link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/21[issue #21: Review C2PA spec for additional X.509 certificate adaptions that might be relevant].

*ACTION:* Scouten to draft a PR that:

* Closes issue #21 and deletes related text in the draft specification.
* Adds guidance that an identity assertion validator should maintain a trust list that is technically similar to the one for C2PA Manifest signatures, but disctint from that list.
* Adds guidance that the planned C2PA trust list is not necessarily relevant for identity assertion validation.

=== 20 min: Domain trust anchor proposal

üé• _29'46":_ Christian Paquin presented a proposal for link:https://github.com/christianpaquin/c2pa-explorations/blob/main/web-domain-trust-anchor/web-domain-trust-anchor.md[Web Domain Trust Anchor in the CAWG identity framework].

Lengthy discussion with a few key points to consider:

* Is this really approachable for non-technical web site owners?
* Is this unnecessarily re-inventing PKI discovery protocols?

*ACTION:* Eric and Christian to collaborate on a proof-of-concept and re-raise discussion when ready.

=== 30 min: Review open issues for identity 1.0 milestone

üé• _29'46":_ Resumed discussion on the link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.0[13 open issues] that were flagged as potentially relevant for the 1.0 version of the identity specification.

* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/38[Issue #38: Attestation from C2PA 1.x]: Closed as no longer relevant.
* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/26[Issue #26: Describe credential holder‚Äôs role in relation to the asset]: Extensive discussion and new related resources in the issue thread. Scouten to review.
* link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/issues/32[Issue #32: Levels of assurance for subject credentials?]: Moved to 1.x-add-vc milestone.

=== 5 min: Closing and review

üé• _57'48":_ Invitation to subsequent meetings, which will typically be on Mondays.
