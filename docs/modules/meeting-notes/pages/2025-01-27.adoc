=== Demo of creds.xyz

ðŸŽ¥ _1h00'20":_ Alex demonstrated link:https://creds.xyz[creds.xyz], a product that aggregates credentials from various sources and creates verifiable presentations, exploring its potential integration with the identity assertion framework. The group agreed that creds.xyz performs a role that is very similar to that described by identity claims aggregation and to further explore a possible integration.

=== Review PR #207: Limit validity period for identity claims verifications

ðŸŽ¥ _1h03'36":_ Reviewed link:https://github.com/creator-assertions/identity-assertion/pull/207[PR #207].

Similar to the discussion in link:++https://cawg.io/meeting-notes/2025-01-21/#_review_pr_207_limit_validity_period_for_identity_claims_verifications++[last week's meeting], the group agreed that:

* The proposal in PR 207 is too arbitrary and needs to be refined. Some identity signals may reasonably be held for longer times than others.
* A possible answer is for the identity claims aggregator to provide information about its intended validation lifetime to:
** The named actor at time of verification. (How long will this information be retained?)
** The identity aggregation _consumer_ at time of validation. (When will the ICA request a renewal?)

=== Meeting cadence

The group agreed to alternating biweekly meetings between NA/EU and APAC.

Eric will announce details of that schedule transition shortly.
