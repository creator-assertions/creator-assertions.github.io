Enhancing trust with verifiable authorship and identity

[.tagline-small]
Building on the work of the link:https://c2pa.org[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)], the *Creator Assertions Working Group* (CAWG) empowers individuals and organizations to assert attribution of digital content while supporting privacy and transparency.
Whether identifying the source of media or protecting creatorsâ€™ rights, CAWG plays a critical role in promoting authenticity, combating misinformation, and shaping a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.
