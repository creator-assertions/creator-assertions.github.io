= Creator Assertions Working Group

The Creator Assertions Working Group (CAWG) builds upon the work of the https://c2pa.org[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity] (C2PA) by defining additional assertions that allow content creators to express individual and organizational intent about their content.

See the https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_technical_overview[C2PA Technical Specification: Technical Overview] for an explanation of the C2PA data model including assertions.
