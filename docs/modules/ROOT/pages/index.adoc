= Creator Assertions Working Group
:page-role: -toc

The Creator Assertions Working Group (CAWG) builds upon the work of the https://c2pa.org[Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity] (C2PA) by defining additional assertions that allow content creators to express individual and organizational intent about their content. CAWG is a working group within the https://identity.foundation[Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)].
