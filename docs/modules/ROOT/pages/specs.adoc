The C2PA link:https://spec.c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html[Content Credentials technical specification]
describes how actors can make cryptographically-signed _assertions_ about a digital asset. 

CAWG develops and maintains the following technical specifications for C2PA assertions:

* **xref:identity:ROOT:index.adoc[]**: Describes an assertion that enables a credential holder to prove control over a digital identity and to use that identity to document the named actor’s role(s) in an asset’s lifecycle.

* **xref:endorsement:ROOT:index.adoc[]**: An endorsement is a way of indicating approval for specific actions made on content after it has had a C2PA Manifest attached.  The endorsement assertion is where an endorsement from the signer of an ingredient C2PA asset is stored. These endorsements are typically provided (out-of-band of this specification) by ingredient C2PA asset signers to actors those signers trust to perform the actions listed in the assertion. They are used by a validator when assessing whether the actions of the active C2PA Manifest are “endorsed” or not. 

* **xref:metadata:ROOT:index.adoc[]**: Describes an assertion for binding metadata from standards such as XMP, IPTC, and Exif to a C2PA Manifest in a tamper-evident way.  Unlike the c2pa.metadata assertion from the C2PA technical specification, this specification places no restrictions on which metadata fields may be included, so it supports a broader set of use cases and makes it well-suited for use in gathered_assertions in the C2PA claim schema, where the signer of the C2PA Manifest does not attest to the accuracy of the provided metadata but still ensures the integrity of the C2PA Manifest.

* **xref:training-and-data-mining:ROOT:index.adoc[]**: Describes an assertion that enables a human actor to provide a C2PA Manifest consumer information about whether an asset with C2PA metadata may be used as part of a data mining or AI/ML training workflow.

See the https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html#_technical_overview[C2PA Technical Specification: Technical Overview] for an explanation of the C2PA data model including assertions.
